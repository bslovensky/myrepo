The data that I found listed all the shows and movies on Netflix. I found it on kaggle.com. I was going to try to predict which Netflix had more of between shows and movies.
```{r}
summary(netflix_titles_CLEANSED_oCzwoN)
```
The summary of the data shows that the earliest a show or movie was released was 1925 while the latest is 2021. With each field being character fields, statistics were unable to be run on all of them.
```{r}

```
